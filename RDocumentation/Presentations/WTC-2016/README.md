For the
[Wolfram Technology Conference 2016](https://www.wolfram.com/events/technology-conference/2016/)
I made [a mind-map with URLs](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaVsR/blob/master/RDocumentation/Presentations/WTC-2016/WTC-2016-Antonov-Mathematica-vs-R-Advanced-use-cases-mind-map-with-links.pdf) instead of slides.

The [PDF file](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaVsR/raw/master/RDocumentation/Presentations/WTC-2016/WTC-2016-Antonov-Mathematica-vs-R-Advanced-use-cases-mind-map-with-links.pdf) in this folder is with the mind-map.

The [Markdown file](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaVsR/blob/master/RDocumentation/Presentations/WTC-2016/WTC-2016-Antonov-Mathematica-vs-R-Advanced-use-cases-mind-map-with-links.md) is a hierarchical version of that mind-map.
