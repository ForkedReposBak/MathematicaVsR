# MathematicaVsR

## In brief

This repository has examples, code, and documents for comparing
[*Mathematica*](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) with
[R](https://www.r-project.org).


### Mission statement

The development in this code repository aims to provide a collection
of relatively simple but non-trivial example projects that illustrate
the use of *Mathematica* and R in different statistical, machine
learning, scientific, and software engineering programming activities.

Each of the projects has implementations and documents made with both
*Mathematica* and R -- hopefully that would allow comparison and
knowledge transfer.


## Projects organization

Each project has an introductory page (README.md) that lists
its goals, concrete steps, and links to documents and scripts with full
explanations and code.

Generally, an introductory page would also have sections with comparison
observations and development history.

Each project (generally) has two directories named "Mathematica" and
"R" that have corresponding documents and code.


## Where to begin

This presentation,
["Mathematica vs. R"](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaVsR/blob/master/RDocumentation/Presentations/WTC-2015/WTC-2015-Antonov-Mathematica-vs-R.pdf)
given at the [Wolfram Technology Conference 2015](https://www.wolfram.com/events/technology-conference/2015/) is probably a good start.
