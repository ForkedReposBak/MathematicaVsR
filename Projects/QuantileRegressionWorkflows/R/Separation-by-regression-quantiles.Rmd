# Introduction

Basic, introductory example to illustrate how Quantile Regression works using the package 
[QRMon](https://github.com/antononcube/QRMon-R).

For detailed explanations see the vignette 
["Rapid making of Quantile Regression workflows"](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/antononcube/QRMon-R/blob/master/notebooks/rapid-making-of-qr-workflows.html).

Here is a 
[diagram](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaForPrediction/raw/master/MarkdownDocuments/Diagrams/A-monad-for-Quantile-Regression-workflows/QRMon-pipeline.jpg)
showing the concepts in a QRMon pipeline (in Mathematica notation.)

# Installation and libraries load

The package/librart QRMon can be installed with the command:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("antononcube/QRMon-R")
```
Then we load that package with:

```{r}
library(QRMon)
```

Sometimes I have to explicitly load the dependency libraries:

```{r}
library(splines)
library(quantreg)
library(purrr)
library(magrittr)
library(ggplot2)
```

Those libraries can be installed with the command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages( "quantreg", "purrr", "magrittr", "ggplot2")
```


# Computation pipelines

Below the curves produced by Quantile Regression are called "regression quantiles".

## The monad object

A QRMon monad object is a S3 object and it is constructed with`QRMonUnit`.

Here are the S3 object element names: 

```{r}
names(QRMonUnit())
```

Here is the class attribute:

```{r}
class(QRMonUnit())
```

**Remarks:**

- The class attribute is not used/respected in QRMon's functions because they use the prefix "QRMon".

- Some of QRMon's functions can put additional elements into the monad object.

## Fractions of points 

Here we compute the fractions of the points separated by the regression quantiles with 
the following pipeline:

```{r}
qFracs <-
  QRMonUnit( setNames(dfTemperatureData, c("Time", "Value")) ) %>%       # Get data
  QRMonQuantileRegression( df = 12, quantiles = seq(0.2,0.8,0.2) ) %>%   # Quantile Regression with B-splines
  QRMonPlot %>%                                                          # Plot data and regression quantiles
  QRMonSeparateToFractions %>%                                           # Separate the points and find fractions
  QRMonTakeValue                                                         # Take the value of the monad object
```


```{r}
qFracs
```

The above result should :

- illustrate what Quantile Regression does, and

- convince us that the concrete QRMon implementation works.


## Separated points with different colors 

Let use make a more interesting example by plotting the points separated by the regression quantiles
with different colors.

### Separation

First we compute a non-cumulative point separation:

```{r}
qFracPoints <-
  QRMonUnit( setNames(dfTemperatureData, c("Time", "Value")) ) %>%
  QRMonQuantileRegression( df = 12, quantiles = seq(0.2,0.8,0.2) ) %>%
  QRMonPlot(datePlotQ = T, dateOrigin = "1900-01-01") %>%               # Make a date-axis plot
  QRMonSeparate( cumulativeQ = FALSE ) %>%                              # Non-cumulative point sets
  QRMonTakeValue()
```

This shows that found point sets have roughly the same number of elements that adger

```{r}
purrr::map(qFracPoints, nrow)
```

### Plot

Here we plot the seprated points with different colors:

```{r}
qDF <- 
  purrr::map_df( 
    names(qFracPoints), 
    function(x) cbind( Quantile = x, qFracPoints[[x]], stringsAsFactors = FALSE )
  )

qDF$Time <- as.POSIXct( qDF$Time, origin = "1900-01-01" )

ggplot(qDF) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Time, y = Value, color = Quantile) )
```
