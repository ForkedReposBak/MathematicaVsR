# Deep learning examples

## Introduction

This project is to compare the Deep Learning functionalities in R/RStudio and Mathematica/Wolfram Language.

The project is aimed to mirror and aid the talk 
["Deep Learning series (session 2)"](https://www.meetup.com/Orlando-MLDS/events/250086544/)
of the meetup
[Orlando Machine Learning and Data Science](https://www.meetup.com/Orlando-MLDS).

The focus of the talk is R and Keras, so the project structure is strongly influenced by the content 
of the book [Deep learning with R](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-r), \[1\]. 


## The presentation
