# Deep learning examples

## Introduction

This project for the comparison of the Deep Learning functionalities in R/RStudio and Mathematica/Wolfram Language (WL).

The project is aimed to mirror and aid the talk 
["Deep Learning series (session 2)"](https://www.meetup.com/Orlando-MLDS/events/250086544/)
of the meetup
[Orlando Machine Learning and Data Science](https://www.meetup.com/Orlando-MLDS).

The focus of the talk is R and Keras, so the project structure is strongly influenced by the content 
of the book [Deep learning with R](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-r), \[1\]. 

Some of the WL's notebooks repeat the material in \[2\]. Some are original versions.

WL's Neural Nets framework and abilities are fairly well described in the 
reference page 
["Neural Networks in the Wolfram Language overview"](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/NeuralNetworksOverview.html), \[4\],
and the [webinar talks](http://www.wolfram.com/broadcast/c?c=442) \[5\].

The corresponding documentation pages 
\[[3](https://keras.rstudio.com/reference/index.html)\] (R) and 
\[[6](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/NeuralNetworks.html)\] (WL) 
can be used for a very fruitful comparison of features and abilities.
