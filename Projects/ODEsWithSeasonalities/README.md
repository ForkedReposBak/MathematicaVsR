This Mathematica vs. R comparison project started from the Mathematica StackExchange discussion

[ODE w/seasonal forcing term"](http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/95015/ode-w-seasonal-forcing-term/).

Here is how to run the examples:

 1. Mathematica
 1.1. Copy and paste the code in the file "Mathematica/ODEsWithSeasonalities.m" in the directory Mathematica.
 1.2. Alternatively, use the command Import for that file.

 2. R
 2.1. Download the file "R/AirPollutionODEsSolverInterface.R" and run the command
 
		Rscript AirPollutionODEsSolverInterface.R

 2.2. Alternatively, create a project in R IDE with the file R/AirPollutionODEsSolver.R .
